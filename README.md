# Rotating Cube

This is the implementation of  a cube that can rotate in all 6DoF.

It is implemented in JS and uses WebGL for rendering. 

Most of the source code was copied from a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yLL9ADo-ko) by Indigo Code and adapted to work as intended.

## Usage

Open the HTML file in a browser that supports WebGL or experimental-WebGL. The cube will appear.

In order translate it use left and right arrows to move in the X axis, up and down arrows to move it in the Y axis and left control and left shift to move in the Z axis.

To rotate the cube in the Z axis use A and D. For the X axis use W and S. Finally, for the Y axis use Z and X.
